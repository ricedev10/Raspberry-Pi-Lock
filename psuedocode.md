# Goal

1. To create a 4-digit (or larger) padlock
2. When pressing one of 4 buttons, a corresponding LED lights up to indicate it was pressed
3. LCD Display (for display "Incorrect/Correct" and other information)
4. A fifth button to enter the pin
5. Optionally: A buzzer that "buzzes" if the pin is incorrect

# Setting & Resetting the Pin

1. After successfully entering the pin, you can press the 5th button to "open" OR you can _hold_ the button to reset the pin (instructions on LCD Display)
2. After _holding_ the 5th button, you type in a code, then press the same 5th button again to finalize the new code (hopefully you don't forget it...)
