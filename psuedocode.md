# Goal

1. To create a 4-digit padlock
2. When pressing one of 4 buttons, a corresponding LED lights up to indicate it was pressed
3. LCD Display (for display "Incorrect/Correct" and other information)
4. After pressing 4 digits, program automatically detects if it is correct or not
5. LCD display will show:
    a. Incorrect: Enter code again
    b. Correct: Automatically opens drawer and gives options to press button A for changing keycode (see Setting & Resetting the Pin below) & button B for closing drawer 

# Setting & Resetting the Pin

1. After successfully entering the pin, you can press the 5th button to "open" OR you can _hold_ the button to reset the pin (instructions on LCD Display)
2. After _holding_ the 5th button, you type in a code, then press the same 5th button again to finalize the new code (hopefully you don't forget it...)
